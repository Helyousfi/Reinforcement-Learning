## The main difference between SARSA and Q-learning : <br>
In Q learning, we choose tha maximum of Q' over all possible actions for the next step. <br>
SARSA uses the Q' following a Îµ-greedy policy exactly, as A' is drawn from it <br>

To learn how to play a game, for example, the Q learning algorithm will start by making a choice between exploration and exploitation of the data. The AI agent can opt for exploration if it has no experience. Otherwise, it will opt for data mining. Once it has performed an action, the agent moves to the next step where it makes new decisions. During its learning process, the AI agent progresses slowly according to the experience gained.  <br>
